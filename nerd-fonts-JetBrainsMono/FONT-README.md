# JetBrainsMono
A typeface made for developers. \
More about font features & design can be found on [its page](https://jetbrains.com/mono/).

# **Installation**

### **In JetBrains IDEs**

The most recent version of JetBrains Mono ships with your JetBrains IDE starting with v2019.3.

Select JetBrains Mono in the IDE settings: go to `Preferences/Settings` → `Editor` → `Font`, and then select JetBrains Mono from the Font dropdown.

### Another IDE or an older version of a JetBrains IDE

1. [Download font](https://download.jetbrains.com/fonts/JetBrainsMono-1.0.0.zip?fromGitHub). 
2. Unzip the archive and install the font:
   - Mac. Select all font files in the folder and double-click them. Click the *"Install Font"* button.
   - Windows. Select all font files in the folder, right-click any of them, then pick *"Install"* from the menu.
   - Ubuntu. Open a terminal with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T` and run the following:
   
      ```
      cd <name_of_our_archive.zip>
      unzip "\*.zip" -d ${HOME}/.fonts
      sudo fc-cache -f -v
      ```
3. Restart your IDE.
4. Go to `Preferences/Settings` → `Editor` → `Font`, and pick JetBrains Mono from the Font dropdown.

### **Visual Studio Code**

* Follow the instructions above to step 3.
* Go to the settings editor, from the File menu choose Preferences, Settings or use keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+, (`Cmd`+, on Mac).
* In the *"Font Family"* input box type JetBrains Mono, replacing any content.
* To enable ligatures turn on the checkbox in *"Font ligatures"*.

#### **Manually editing settings.json**

Visual Studio Code allows you to also edit the underlying settings.json config file. First open the settings editor as described above, then click the "`{}`" icon, at the top right, to open the *"settings.json"* file.

Then paste the following lines and save the file.

```
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

## Source files

Can be found in the *"Source"* folder. To open them you will need FontLab 6 or higher.

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `'complete'` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `'Windows Compatible'` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `'Mono'` suffix.
    * This denotes that the Nerd Font glyphs will be monospaced not necessarily that the entire font will be monospaced

### Ligatures

By the *Nerd Font* policy, the variant with the `'Mono'` suffix is not supposed to have any ligatures.
Use the non-*Mono* variants to have ligatures.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * download an already patched font from the `complete` folder
   * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from all of the glyph sets. Only caution here is that some fonts have glyphs in the _same_ code point so to include everything some had to be moved to alternate code points.

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (see each font's readme for full list of combinations available)
   * This is the option you want if the font you use is _not_ already included or you want maximum control of what's included
   * This contains a list of _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [Devicons][vorillaz-devicons]. The goal is to provide every combination possible in this folder.

## Variations (Combinations)

> The combinations and total number of combinations are provided here for reference if you want to create your own variation of a patched Nerd Font.

### Why aren't all variations included ?

Combinations are no longer included by default because of the large inflation in size it caused the Repository _and_ the amount of time it takes to rebuild all of the combinations. This issue would exponentially get worse as the numbers of Fonts and Glyph Sets provided increase.
